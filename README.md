yawi - Yet Another Wordle Implementation

# Overview
Like 63% of the devs on the planet, I decided to make a wordle clone. This is
the base class for the game itself.

This will always include the Wordle_Game class (which is just a class that
  implements a single game of Wordle).

# Future Development
- Definition of a base Agent class that will make guesses and parse guess scores.
- More Agents that will play games of Wordle with various approaches.
- A testbed to allow for head to head competition of various Agents.
